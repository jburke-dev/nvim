# NeoVim Config

This repository includes all the files used to setup my NeoVim to be a complete IDE.  The configuration is intended to be portable, but does have a few prerequisites.

## Requirements

* NeoVim 0.9+ -> See [Installing via AppImage](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#appimage-universal-linux-package)
* Modern NodeJS -> See [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* A 256-color capable terminal with a patched font (I use WSL in Windows Terminal with a NERD Font)
* Paq -> First time setup requires manual installation of the [Paq](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim) package manager
* Lua LS -> Requires `lua-language-server` to be in `$PATH`.  Can be installed from [here](https://luals.github.io/#neovim-install)
